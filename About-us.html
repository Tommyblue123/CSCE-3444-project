                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>At Share the Spare, we're driven by a single goal: 
                            to make a meaningful impact in the fight against food waste and hunger. 
                            In a world where millions go hungry every day, yet vast amounts of food are wasted, 
                            we saw an opportunity to bridge the gap. Our mission is to create a more sustainable 
                            future by connecting food establishments that have surplus food with local charities and 
                            individuals facing food scarcity.

                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Founded in 2024 by Tommy, Share the Spare started as a small
                            community effort in different communities. Recognizing the critical issue of food wastage in restaurants, 
                            cafes, supermarkets, and other food-related businesses, we embarked on a journey to change the narrative. 
                            What began as a local initiative has grown into a widespread movement, expanding our reach and impact thanks 
                            to the dedication of our team, volunteers, and the generous support of our community.
