# A Food Waste Reduction Website
The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly website that helps to address the critical issue of food wastage by establishing a seamless connection between various types of food establishments that consistently have surplus food and local charities or individuals facing food scarcity. The current scenario witnesses a significant amount of perfectly edible food going to waste from restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, and other food-related businesses, contributing to both environmental concerns and societal challenges related to hunger and food insecurity.
